Learn how to use Python to look at health information and understand it better. This is super important in healthcare because it helps doctors and experts make better choices for patients and public health.\n\nDuring the course, you'll get to work with real health data and figure out how to study it. You'll also learn how to make pictures and graphs that show what the data means, using special Python tools. This course is made for everyone – even if you're new to Python or have used other computer languages before.\n\nJump into this 12-week adventure to learn cool things with Python. We'll show you how Python can totally change how doctors and hospitals work, making things better in Clinical Research, Patient Care, and Hospital Management. Python is a special kind of computer language that's great for websites, science, and smart machines. And the best part? You won't have to worry about confusing rules – you'll just have fun solving problems and making things better with Python! Your journey to making healthcare even cooler starts right here.\n\n\n## Learning Objectives\nBy the end of this course, participants will be able to:\n\n1. Understanding the importance of health data analysis and its role in healthcare decision making\n2. Python libraries (Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib) were used to import, manipulate, and visualize\nhealth-related datasets.\n3. Exploratory data analysis techniques were applied to gain insights and identify patterns in health\ndata.\n4. Preprocess health data, handle missing values, and ensure data quality for machine learning\napplications.\n5. Implementation of basic machine-learning algorithms for predictive modeling.\n6. Evaluate machine learning model performance using evaluation metrics\n7. Perform model optimization and hyperparameter tuning to improve the machine learning model\nperformance.\n8. Explore ethical considerations and challenges related to machine learning in the healthcare\ndomain.\n\n## Pre-Requisites\nUsers will be expected to be comfortable with downloading and running programs on their computers. No prior experience with Python is necessary for the course.\n\n## Target Audience\nThis course is meticulously crafted to cater to a diverse audience of healthcare professionals, researchers, practitioners, and administrators seeking to harness Python's capabilities for enhanced medical practices. Whether you're a medical student, a seasoned physician, a data analyst in the healthcare sector, or an administrator overseeing hospital operations, this course will equip you with the skills to seamlessly integrate Python into your role. No prior programming experience is required, making it accessible to beginners and those with a limited coding background who are eager to leverage Python's power in the healthcare domain.\n\n## Course Goal\nThe overarching goal of this course is to empower participants with a profound understanding of Python's potential in revolutionizing healthcare practices. By the course's completion, attendees will be adept at leveraging Python across diverse facets of the healthcare industry, including Clinical Research, Patient Care, and Hospital Management. Through hands-on learning, real-world applications, and in-depth exploration, participants will emerge with the confidence and skills to contribute effectively to the advancement of healthcare through Python-powered innovation.\n\n## Scope\nBy the end of this course participants will have had a chance to practice the basics of working with Python with hands-on experience developing some real-world applications, all while equipping themselves with the context and awareness for how such tools are leveraged in state of the art solutions.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n```{r, echo=FALSE}\nknitr::include_graphics(\"images/banner.png\")\n```\n\n# Welcome!\nDiscover the power of Python in a 12-week course built just for you.
